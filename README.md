# Conversor-v2

This application allows you to quickly and easily convert between different time zones. Users can select a source time zone and multiple destination cities to view the equivalent time in each location, ensuring that conversions are accurate and reflect daylight saving time changes when applicable. It is a useful tool for planning meetings and events, with the additional option to print a personalized card for the event, showing the times in all selected cities.
